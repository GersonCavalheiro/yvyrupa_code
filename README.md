# Yvyrupa Code

**Yvyrupa Code** is a repository that gathers various implementations of classic algorithms and problems in multiple programming languages, focusing on comparing **concurrent and parallel programming interfaces**. The goal is to explore the **efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness** of the concurrency models and native constructs available in modern languages.

## Objectives

This repository serves as a practical foundation for:

- Empirical study of the expressiveness and overhead of concurrency abstractions.
- Comparisons between models based on threads, channels, processes, and asynchronous tasks.
- Assessment of code readability, actual parallelism, and development effort.
- Investigation of the adoption of OpenMP directives in open-source codebases.

## Contents

The repository is organized by language, including implementations in:

- **Rust**
- **Go**
- **OpenMP**
- **GQM**: This directory contains the raw data collected by the application of the model developed using the GQM method.

Each implementation addresses a classic problem (e.g., producer/consumer, Fibonacci calculation, Game of Life) to highlight different aspects of the concurrent and parallel programming models supported by each language.

## About the name

The name **Yvyrupa Code** refers to the Guarani concept of *Yvyrupa* — the world as a shared, borderless land — symbolizing the coexistence of multiple programming languages within a unified analytical and practical space.
