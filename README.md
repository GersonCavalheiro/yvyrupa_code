# Yvyrupa Code

Yvyrupa Code is a repository that gathers various implementations of classic algorithms and problems in multiple programming languages, focusing on comparing concurrent and parallel programming interfaces. The goal is to explore the efficiency, efficacy, and effectiveness of the concurrency models and native constructs available in modern languages.

## Objectives

This repository serves as a practical foundation for:

- Empirical study of the expressiveness and overhead of concurrency abstractions.
- Comparisons between models based on threads, channels, processes, and asynchronous tasks.
- Assessment of code readability, actual parallelism, and development effort.
- Investigation of the adoption of OpenMP directives in open-source codebases.

## Contents

The repository is organized by language, including implementations in:

- Rust
- Go
- OpenMP
- GQM: This directory contains the raw data collected by the application of the model developed using the GQM method.

Each implementation addresses a classic problem (e.g., producer/consumer, Fibonacci calculation, Game of Life) to highlight different aspects of the concurrent and parallel programming models supported by each language.

## About the name

The name Yvyrupa Code refers to the Guarani concept of Yvyrupa ‚Äî the world as a shared, borderless land ‚Äî symbolizing the coexistence of multiple programming languages within a unified analytical and practical space.
